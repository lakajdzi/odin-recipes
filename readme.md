# ODIN RECIPES - by lakidzi

you will spawn in `index.html` to continue into recipes, you need to click on link called `Lasagna Recipe` it will redirect you to the page `recipes/lasagne.html`

## Lasagna Recipe Page
So first you can see link `Home` that will redirect you back to the `index.html` page.

Second one is a title that says `Lasagna Recipe`, it's bigger so it is why it's called `title`.

under the title we can see an `image` of the lasagne it self.

under image is very describing `description` that is telling us and pointing at some words that has special styling.

under description we can see the `ingredients` and `steps` to cook.

__ingredients have 20 points.__
__steps have only 10 points.__

### That's it. Thanks for watching my repository and also sorry for many potential english misswords if i can call it like that.
